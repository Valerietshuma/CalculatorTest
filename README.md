# This project demonstrates a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to building basic arithmetic functions in JavaScript:

1. Add Function – Adds integers, initially two, then modified to handle multiple integers.

2. Multiply Function – Multiplies integers, initially two, then modified to handle multiple integers.
#  Features
-Add Function

-Multiply Function

# Approach
This project follows the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach:

-Write unit tests for a function.

-Run the tests and watch them fail (since no implementation exists yet).

-Implement the minimum code necessary to pass the tests.

-Refactor the code while ensuring all tests still pass.

# Technologies Used
-JAVA

-Intellij IDEA
